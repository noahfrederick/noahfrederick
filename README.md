Sorry, I'm no longer hosting code on GitHub.[^1]

**You can find up-to-date copies of all code repositories at [codeberg.org/noahfrederick](https://codeberg.org/noahfrederick).**

If you use a Vim/Neovim plug-in managed via Git, you will need to update the name/URL from, e.g., `noahfrederick/vim-plugin-name` to `https://codeberg.org/noahfrederick/vim-plugin-name` to continue receiving updates.

    There are also [other reasons to avoid using GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/), such as the requirement to [run non-free JavaScript](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html) to use certain features of the website, and Microsoft's [unscrupulous business contracts](https://github.com/drop-ice/dear-github-2.0).
