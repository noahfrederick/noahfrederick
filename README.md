Sorry, I'm no longer hosting code on GitHub.

Copilot (a commercial LLM trained on source-available code hosted on GitHub without the authors' knowledge or consent) represents a unilateral incursion by Microsoft, what Shoshana Zuboff describes as the *dispossession cycle*, through which surveillance capitalists lay claim to undefended territory in their quest to capture surplus value (_The Age of Surveillance Capitalism_, 2019).

There are also [other reasons to avoid using GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/), such as the requirement to [run non-free JavaScript](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html) to use certain features of the website, and Microsoft's [unscrupulous business contracts](https://github.com/drop-ice/dear-github-2.0).
